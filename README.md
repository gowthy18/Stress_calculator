# Stress_calculator
 This is a combined project of software and solid mechanics. It is a webpage to calculate stress/strain values at any angle and principal values of stress/strain on an infinitesimal area, when basic values of stress/strain on coordinate axes and angle are given.
 Web application for calculating stress/strain transformations and principal values using Mohr's circle theory with dual-mode functionality.
• Interactive Visualization Interface
Designed responsive UI with real-time Mohr's circle canvas rendering and professional engineering layout using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript.
• Mathematical Algorithm Implementation
Developed coordinate transformation algorithms for 2D mechanics analysis including principal calculations and angular transformations.
how to run;
just copy the html code that it self contains js and css 
and live it
